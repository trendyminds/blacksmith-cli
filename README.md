# ‚öíÔ∏è Blacksmith CLI
### A Forge-provisioning CLI tool for sandboxes

<img src="docs/preview.png" alt="The confirmation notice posted in a pull request when Blacksmith has provisioned a site to your Laravel Forge server">

## ‚úÖ Requirements

When provisioning a sandbox you'll need:
- A Forge API token
- An ID of a Forge server to deploy to

It is imperative to leverage GitHub secrets to ensure you are not commit this type of sensitive data to your codebase and potentially exposing this data to the outside world.

## üöÄ Creating and destroying sandboxes

Below is an example of a GitHub action that will create a new sandbox when it is labeled with a "sandbox" tag in the pull request. When the pull request is closed it will run the decommission action.

```yaml
name: Sandbox

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled, reopened, closed]

jobs:
  sandbox:
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'sandbox')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      FORGE_APP_ID: app
      FORGE_DOMAIN: example.com
      FORGE_DEPLOY_SCRIPT: "npm install; npm run build"
      FORGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BLACKSMITH_FORGE_TOKEN }}
      FORGE_SERVER: ${{ secrets.BLACKSMITH_SANDBOX_SERVER }}
      FORGE_REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
      FORGE_BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      FORGE_PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
      FORGE_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: 8.3
        coverage: none
    - name: Install Blacksmith
      run: composer global require trendyminds/blacksmith-cli
    - name: Create Sandbox (If PR was just opened or reopened)
      if: github.event.action != 'closed'
      run: blacksmith create
    - name: Destroy Sandbox (When PR is closed)
      if: github.event.action == 'closed'
      run: blacksmith destroy
```

## üîí Backups

Unfortunately, Forge's backup configuration and storage processes are asynchronous and, because of this, a lengthy and arbitrary `sleep()` method is used when running these. That means it's _possible_ a database backup when your sandbox is decommissioned may not complete successfully. For tried-and-true backups consider running a separate backup process on Forge to ensure you have a method to restore databases if necessary.

### Git Automation
Git automation should be enabled by including `STATAMIC_GIT_AUTOMATIC` in your environment variables and setting it to `false`.

This means content commits have to be manually performed by visiting Utilties > Git. However, it _greatly_ simplifies your sandbox:

1. You do not need to run Redis in every Statamic sandbox you create handling queued commits
2. You do not need to commit every single content save to your pull request if you do not queue your commits

While `STATAMIC_GIT_AUTOMATIC=false` means some occasional manual labor, it makes the setup simpler and also enables you to create Statamic sandboxes that _shouldn't_ have committed sandbox changes.
